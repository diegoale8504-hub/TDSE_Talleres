## 2. Workshop Objective

The objective of this workshop is to understand the fundamentals of **linear regression** by implementing it from scratch, both in its **non-vectorized** and **vectorized** versions. The workshop analyzes the impact of different hyperparameters such as the learning rate, number of iterations, and noise level in the data.

Additionally, the workshop aims to reinforce the use of **vectorization** to improve computational efficiency and code clarity.
